## What's this?
 
 This is a basic project that show how you can deploy a basic website using Terraform and AWS   
  
## Let's do it
 
 - You will need Terraform 4.33.0 or higher
 - Also an AWS account
 - Time to download this repo ans place over main directory
 - Just type ```Terraform init```
 - Then type ```Terraform apply``` (If you are using a Terraform old version, you will need type ```Terraform apply``` twice) 
 
## Files-included-in-this-repo

- buckets.tf : It Contains instructions to build a S3 bucket with a basic website configuration. In adition policies, ACL and uploaded objects has been included.

- error.html : Just a basic error webpage.<h1 align="center"><img src="/images/error.jpg" alt="error" width=300 height=230>

- provider.tf : Basic provider requirements... just copy/pasted from https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws

- variables.tf : A simple example that how you can use variables.
 
 
## Let's finish it
 
- Just type ```Terraform destroy```  (If you are using a Terraform old version, you will need type ```Terraform destroy``` twice)
  
Note:
```terraform destroy``` does not delete the S3 Bucket ACL but does remove the resource from Terraform state.
